## About

Another fun project - very similar to [d4v1d](https://github.com/MattMoony/d4v1d). Could be quite useful for recon, but even if not, it was just nice to experiment with.

## Setup

Assuming that you have Python 3.* already installed on your system, all you need to do is execute the following in the project's directory:

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

_Coming soon_
